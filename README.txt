OT-2 image analysis is where I put together the template that exists within full data set. This folder is also what I used to practice with any functions I didn't understand. Some of the folders are just attempts to analyze a full video. 

again - attempt to analyze full video

benchMarking - this directory contains all of the bench marking photos, scripts, and goniometer files

csvPractice - figure out how to incorporate csv into our code and use a master csv

graphics - I made images for my graphical abstract and presentation and such

newBackground - a directory containing images of the normalized new paper background and scripts to detect contours

retry - attempt to analyze full video

scripts - the home of my original scripts. If the template or complete Processing module is not making sense it may be helpful to visit this folder. new5.py, chopVideo.py and binaryreference.py all contributed to the full module

Set2 - attempt to analyze full video\

shapeMatch - this directories original use was to find and save a reference contour to compare contours in our images to. Also the original home of the processing module and its first incorporation into the scripts is in trial1. trial2 is essentially trial1 without the processing module imported









































if you have read all this way that means you came looking for a very specific something. It is apparent you seek knowledge regarding that which is held on the utmost pedestal in these lands. You truly do have an obsession for perfection...For you see the directory in which you inquiry is no ordinary directory. No, not at all, it is a directory as old as time its self. That contains sights only to lay your eyes upon carefully. For if you take up this curiosity you must rise to greatness. Its time to stop walking, stop jogging, and start sprinting. Sprint to greatness. Rise to greatness. For you see this magical directory contains no other than the mystical 6'3 250 +/- 0.000000 lbs of lean muscle which labels itself Titan Gilroy. Not only does it contain Titan and his epic power, but it also holds the secrets to create art as beautiful as Mona Lisa and as powerful as Banksy. This is the final gift I am leaving to the Ma Research Lab.
